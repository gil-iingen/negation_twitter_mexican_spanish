# Corpus and experiments regarding negation on twitter mexican spanish

The main goal of this research paper is to introduce a valuable resource to analyze the negation statements embedded in the language employed in social media. Specifically, we present the first Mexican Spanish corpus consisting of posts extracted from Twitter which is annotated by human annotators with labels identifying the negation cues, the scope and the event related to the negations. 

We carried out an analysis of the annotation results calculating inter-annotator agreement at all levels of annotation, negation token, full negation scope, and full negation event. The obtained resource is freely available and it can be used in different natural language processing pipelines.
